            <h2>Family</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>One thing that is very important to me is my family. 
                This is because they are always they are always there for me. 
                I've learned a lot of lessons from them. 
                I like spending time with them doing activities and talking.
                I feel the most comftorable around them. Thats why family is one of the most important things to me.

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Basketball is another thing I care about.
                I like playing it with friends to have fun and past time.
                It also keeps me in shape and overall is one of my favorite sports.

            <h2>School</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Although I hate waking up so early in the morning, I know that school is very important.
                It has allowed me to learn a lot of new things and also meet new people and make friends.
